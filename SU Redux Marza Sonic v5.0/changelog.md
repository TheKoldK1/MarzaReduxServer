## SU Redux Marza Sonic V5.3
IT'S DEXEMBER LADS AND LASSES! Thank you all for your incredible support. We hit 1,893 downloads for the last build 4 months back. That's insane! We're bringing a new update that polishes, adds and optimises the mod. Please take a look at the changes:

- THIS UPDATE WAS BROUGHT TO YOU BY STARLIGHTDX, THE KOLD K1 AND MENTOR DEX

- Added support for UP: Complete Addon's new update
- Restored SU frontal boost colour.
- Added Redux SFX to the Japanese sound archive.
- Reverted 2D slope physics back to Unleashed's. No more slope issues.
- Lowered the concrete footsteps, braking and landing sounds.
- Lowered the boost's sound barrier sound a little.
- This mod now makes use of the new AR file loading method -> +NameOfARfile.ar/arl. This means the mod isn't as big as it used to be which is absolutely fantastic!
- Cleaned up the folder layout & files to avoid duplicate files. Redux Sonic would've been over 1 GB if it wasn't for this!
